"""The stdio MCP server that Claude Code launches for `ucu`.

    ucu-proxy.py [--turn-idle S] [--stop-grace S] [--stop-idle S]

Each chat's Claude Code process starts its own copy, so everything below is per chat. The work on apps is done by
agent-desktop, the engine in this repository, which `ucu install` builds and copies to ~/.local/bin/ucu-engine. The
server runs it once per action, and adds what makes it fit for working next to a person:

* `look` and `act`: an app's accessibility tree as short numbered text, the changes since the last look instead of the
  whole tree, and steps that end with what they changed, so a task takes few round trips and few tokens. A step that
  fails says why in terms of these tools, with the window as it is now when the agent needs it to go on, and a
  screenshot is a picture that models read as it is, so its pixels are places in the window;
* a deny list: ~/Library/Application Support/ucu/policy.json holds the apps agents can't touch, read at every call. Each
  app a chat starts using goes to ~/Library/Logs/ucu/approve.log with the client and folder. If the file can't be read,
  no app is used;
* `list_windows`, `focus_window` and `move_to_desktop`, through ~/.local/bin/ucu-window, which `ucu install` builds from
  native/ucu-window.swift;
* apps stay out of the user's way. `ucu-window watch` opens a closed app hidden. Actions work on a hidden app, and a
  click by position that needs a window on screen moves the app to the agent's desktop, a virtual display nobody sees.
  An app the chat drives can't take the user's focus: if it comes to the front by itself, or makes a window of its out
  of sight the main one, while the chat works or just after, the user gets theirs back. A click, a modifier key, Return,
  or their app going out of sight counts as the user switching apps themselves, but their typing doesn't;
* a Safari and a Chrome window of each chat's own through the `safari` and `chrome` tools (native/browser.js);
* a note when another chat is using the app, through one small file per chat in
  ~/Library/Application Support/ucu/sessions;
* a cursor color of each chat's own, kept in that same file, for the cursor `ucu-window watch` draws at each action;
* notes on what the agent wouldn't see: new windows, sheets and system dialogs, and the macOS alert sound, which the
  server hears in the system sound server's log. It needs no permission and hears no audio;
* the usage rules in the `instructions` of the `initialize` reply, so they reach every client;
* updates: as it starts, it runs `ucu update --auto` in the background, which brings this clone up to date at most every
  10 minutes and rebuilds what changed. The next chat runs the new version;
* stops `ucu-window watch` and the log stream once the chat has not used them for --stop-grace seconds after a turn
  ended (default 120), or --stop-idle seconds in any case (default 900). While apps ucu opened still run, the helper
  stays, guarding them until the chat ends, when it quits them. The Stop hook that `ucu install` adds sends
  SIGINFO when Claude's turn ends (`pkill -INFO -P $PPID -f ucu-proxy.py`), and without one a turn ends after
  --turn-idle seconds without a call (default 120).

Its tests are in tests/test_proxy.py, tests/test_policy.py, tests/test_alerts.py and tests/test_windows.py.

- Prefer numbers over positions. Use `xy` for what has no number, with pixels from a `look` screenshot.
- With several windows, pass part of a title as `window`. Calls for different apps can run together.
- Everything works in the background. Bring an app to the front only when the user asks to see it or be taken \
there (focus_window with activate, or `show` in the browser tools), never to make an action work, and never use the \
clipboard, which is theirs. If something can't be done in the background, ask the user.
- ucu opens a closed app out of the user's sight. Never use `open`, AppleScript or System Events on apps.
- For Safari and Chrome, use the `safari` and `chrome` tools: they work in your own window while the user is in \
theirs. Put what belongs together in one call's `steps`.
- If an action has no visible effect, stop and tell the user: remote-desktop and canvas apps can ignore background \

- Always confirm right before acting: deleting data; changing permissions; the last step of creating an account; API \

software or extensions; messages, posts, likes, forms, bookings or anything else that speaks for the user; \

- Confirm unless the first prompt allowed it: logins (going to a site implies logging in to that site), browser \
permission prompts, age checks, third-party "are you sure?" warnings, uploads, moving or renaming files, and sending \
sensitive data, which includes typing it into a form or a URL. That approval must name the data and the destination.
