## Why UCU

| Capability | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| Works in the background | Agents click, type and read other apps without moving your pointer or taking focus. |
| Stays out of your way | A closed app opens on a private desktop you never see, and apps agents drive can't take your focus. |
| Has its own desktop | Apps that need clicks by position run on a private desktop you never see. |
| Clicks anything | A click by position presses the element at that point, or sends raw input to the window, even a canvas with no accessibility tree. |
| Shares your browsers | The `safari` and `chrome` tools work in the agent's own window, so you keep your tabs and your keyboard. |
| Runs side by side | Each chat has its own engine, and is told when another is using the same app. |
| Has its own cursors | Each chat gets a cursor color of its own, so you can tell at a glance who is doing what. |
| Sees every window | Agents are told when an app opens a new window, a sheet or a system dialog, with its text and buttons. |
| Hears errors | When an app plays the macOS alert sound, the agent is told. |
| Light on tokens and round trips | The model reads short numbered text and only what changed, acts by name, and does many steps in one call. |
| You choose the apps | Every app is approved except the ones you deny, with one command. |
| Shows who did what | Every app a chat uses is logged with the agent and folder that used it. |

## How fast it is

One M3 Max with macOS 27.2, on apps on the private desktop. Run it yourself with `python3 -I benchmarks/run.py`.

| Test (median) | UCU |
| --- | ---: |
| Start the server | 45 ms |
| Read a small window (Calculator) | 260 ms |
| Tokens to read a small window | 169 |
| A click, and reading what it changed | 0.5 s |
| A task: `12 + 34 =` and read the answer | 1.5 s |
| The same task by the buttons' names | 1.5 s, in one call instead of a look and an act |
| A step that changes nothing | 0.9 s |
| A look with a screenshot | 0.4 s, a 21 KB picture |
| Read a large window (Font Book) | 1.1 s |
| Tokens to read a large window | 1,403 |
| Tokens to find one thing in it with `find` | 86 |
| Tokens to set up a session | 2,288 |
| Server memory | 23 MB, plus about 20 MB for each chat's engine while it runs |

Tokens are estimated as characters / 4. On a long web page, a Wikipedia article in Chrome, a `look` is 4,150 tokens
where the whole tree is 12,454, a `find` in it 63, and the page's first 300 links and controls are 4,285. A step
that changes nothing on that page takes 1.1 s, and a screenshot of its 1280 x 900 window is 290 KB.

## Before you use it

- **Agents get real access.** Anything an app can do, an agent can do through it. Deny the apps you want to keep them
  out of.
- **The private desktop is a virtual display.** It uses a private macOS feature, and it appears in your display settings
  while an agent needs it.
- **Raw clicks use a macOS function Apple doesn't document.** Without it, a click by position only reaches elements that
  can be pressed.

## Requirements

- macOS, with the Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- Rust, through [rustup](https://rustup.rs)
- Python 3.9 or newer
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), with the `claude` command on your `PATH`

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/betoxf/universal-computer-use.git
cd universal-computer-use/ucu
./ucu install
./ucu doctor
```

UCU runs from this folder, so keep it, and it updates itself from there (see [Update](#update)). Start a new Claude Code
session to pick it up; open sessions need a restart. If `doctor` reports a problem, it says what to do next. The app that
runs Claude Code, such as Terminal, needs Accessibility permission in **System Settings > Privacy & Security >
Accessibility**, and Screen Recording for screenshots.

`./ucu install` backs up what it changes to `~/Library/Application Support/ucu/backups/<time>/`, then:

- builds the engine to `~/.local/bin/ucu-engine` and the helper to `~/.local/bin/ucu-window`
- writes the approval policy, unless you already have one
- registers the `ucu` server in `~/.claude.json`
- adds a `Stop` hook to `~/.claude/settings.json`, so UCU knows when Claude's turn ends
- registers `ucu` in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, if opencode is set up
- lets UCU's Chrome extension start its host, if Chrome is set up (see [Safari and Chrome](#safari-and-chrome))

To make Claude Code prefer UCU over its built-in computer use, add this to your `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
To operate native Mac apps, use the `ucu` MCP server instead of the built-in computer-use tools.
```

## Choosing which apps agents can use

Agents can use every app except the ones you deny. A new install denies password managers, Keychain Access
and System Settings.

```bash
./ucu deny "Mail"      # block an app
./ucu allow "Mail"     # unblock it
./ucu denied           # list the blocked apps
```

Changes apply at the next call, with no restart. Names match regardless of case, and a bundle id such as
`com.apple.mail` works too. The list is in `~/Library/Application Support/ucu/policy.json`. If that file is missing or
broken, no app is used, so a denied app can't slip through.

The first use of each app by a chat, and every refusal, goes to `~/Library/Logs/ucu/approve.log`:

```
2026-10-31 14:02:11 claude-code:my-project allowed Google Chrome
2026-10-31 14:02:40 opencode:website denied Mail
```

## Tools

- `look {app, window?, find?, full?, screenshot?}`: an app's window as numbered text, then only what changed, up to 300
  lines. `find` shows only the lines with a text, under what they are inside of, and `full` the whole tree.
- `act {app, window?, steps}`: steps in order, then what changed. It stops at the first step that fails.
- `list_windows {app?}`: the windows of an app, or of every app, and which is the main window.
- `focus_window {app, title, unfullscreen?, activate?}`: makes a window the main window. With `activate: true`, the
  window comes to your screen and the front, only when you ask to see it.
- `move_to_desktop {app}`: moves an app's windows to the agent's private desktop.
- `safari {op, ...}` and `chrome {op, ...}`: work in Safari and Google Chrome in the agent's own tabs.

A step is `{do, on, ...}`, where `on` is a number from `look`, or `{do, name, ...}` with the element's name, which needs
no `look` first:

```json
{"app": "Calculator", "steps": [{"do": "click", "on": 15}, {"do": "click", "name": "Equals"}]}
```

`do` is `click`, `double-click`, `right-click`, `triple-click`, `focus`, `toggle`, `check`, `uncheck`, `expand`,
`collapse`, `clear`, `scroll-to`, `type` or `set-value` (with `text`), `select` (with `text`), `scroll` (with `direction`
and `amount`), `press` (with `keys`), `menu` (with `text` such as `File > New Window`) or `wait` (until `text` shows in
the window, for up to `amount` seconds). For a click where there is neither number nor name, pass `xy` with pixels from
a `look` screenshot.

A model's round trip costs far more than the action it asks for, so these are made to save them. A named element is
looked up in the window as it is now, waited for briefly if a step before brings it, and found again if the window
changed under it. A name that fits several elements fails with their numbers. `menu` works on an app in the background,
even a hidden one, and a wrong path answers with what that menu holds. An `act` on a window the model hasn't read
returns the window, not a diff. A text that only repeats the element it is in, as a link's does, is left out.

A number means the element the model saw under it. If the window was rebuilt since, UCU finds that element in the window
as it is now and tries the step once more. A step that still fails says which element and why, in terms of these tools
and not the engine's. When steps before it ran, or its number is out of date, the window as it is now comes with the
error, so the model goes on without a `look`. `double-click`, `triple-click` and `right-click` go to where an element is
when it takes no such action of its own, still in the background. A step that closes its window answers that it
closed. A window named by its title is found once per call, so a step that changes the title, as a page that loads
does, doesn't lose it.

A screenshot is the window without its shadow, as a JPEG of one pixel per point. A window larger than models read as it
is (1568 pixels on the long side, 1.15 megapixels) gets fewer. So a client doesn't shrink the picture, and `xy` is the
place the model sees.

When an app rejects an input it plays the macOS alert sound, which a person hears but an agent can't. UCU watches the
system sound server's log and adds a note to the result. It needs no permission and hears no audio. New windows work the
same way, and system dialogs such as password prompts too:

```
[ucu: Safari opened a dialog titled "Sign in". Its text: "Enter your password". Buttons: "Cancel", "OK". To act on it, pass its title as `window`.]
```

The server sends the usage rules in its MCP `instructions`, so clients get them without their own config.

### Staying out of your way

When an agent uses a closed app, UCU opens it on the agent's private desktop, a screen you never see. Its Dock icon
shows it is running, and nothing appears on your screens. A hidden app shows itself wherever its windows are as soon as
it comes forward, so UCU's apps live where showing shows you nothing, and a new window such an app opens joins it there
at once. Agents read it, take screenshots and act on it as usual, clicks by position too. If your Mac can't make the
private desktop, the app stays hidden instead, and goes back into hiding whenever it comes forward. A denied app stays
closed.

Agents never need the front: every action works in the background, and a shortcut such as Command-N runs through the
app's menu, which works even on a hidden app. The usage rules tell agents to bring an app forward only when you ask to
see it or be taken there, never to make an action work, and to leave your clipboard alone.

Apps still come forward by themselves, such as Chrome when it opens a window or an extension's popup. UCU puts your app
back at once, usually within a few hundredths of a second, and tells the agent: for an app it opened, whenever that
happens while the chat runs; for an app you use too, while the chat works on it and for 10 seconds after. When the
agent's own step is what brings it forward, such as making its Chrome window, that always happens, unless you clicked a
window of that app just then. Otherwise UCU leaves the app in front if you clicked, pressed a modifier key, or hold
Return just before, or if your app is no longer in sight, because you may have switched apps or Spaces yourself. Typing
in your app doesn't count, since that is when a stolen focus hurts most. A new app that starts during a call is held
back too, unless you did anything since just before it started.

Safari and Chrome are yours while an agent works in them, because it works in tabs or a window of its own. When no step of the
agent's is bringing the browser forward, you are the one coming to it, so UCU leaves you there however you came: by a
link you clicked a few seconds ago, the Dock, a launcher or a script.

While you are in an app a chat drives, one of the agent's windows out of sight can get the keyboard, such as its Chrome
window when it is made or shown. Your window gets it back at once, so your typing lands where you can see it.

When you ask to see what the agent is doing, or to be taken there, `focus_window` with `activate: true` brings that
window from the private desktop to your screen and to the front, and the browser tools' `show` brings you the agent's
window, which you both use from then on. That is the only way UCU brings anything forward.

Every time an app comes forward during agent work, `~/Library/Logs/ucu/focus.log` says what UCU did, naming the apps but
no window titles, and `ucu doctor` sums up the last day.

### The private desktop

Each chat that needs one gets a virtual display, called UCU Agent Desktop, 1920 by 1200. macOS treats its windows as on
screen, so they keep rendering and take clicks, but nobody sees them. It touches your screens at one corner at most, so
your pointer won't wander onto it, and it appears in System Settings > Displays while it exists.

UCU creates it on first use and removes it 2 minutes after a turn ends, or when the chat closes. macOS moves the
other chats' desktops when one goes, with their windows, and each chat follows its own. A chat whose apps UCU
opened are still running keeps it between turns instead, with the guard that puts your app back, so none of them can
come forward over you while the agent is away. When that chat closes, UCU quits the apps it opened and you never took
over; one asking about unsaved changes stays open, hidden, until you look at it. If you click such an app in the Dock,
its windows come back to your screen, and the app is yours from then on. If virtual displays are not available, apps are
shown behind your windows instead. A window left there when the desktop goes, such as an agent's browser window after a
crash, goes to the Dock rather than onto your screen.

### Safari and Chrome

Agents use the `safari` and `chrome` tools, and UCU tells them to if they name the browser while you are in it. Several
agents can work at once, and you keep browsing:

- `list` shows every window and tab, yours too, and which are the agent's.
- `open` loads a page in a new tab of the agent's own.
- `navigate`, `read`, `click`, `type`, `wait` and `eval` work in the agent's tabs, in the background. `type` puts text
  in through the browser's own text insertion, so the page gets input events the browser vouches for.
- `steps` runs several of these in one call, such as open, type, click, wait and read, and stops at the first that
  fails. `read` with `what: "interactive"` lists a page's links and controls as one short line each.
- `upload` gives a page local files without its file picker, which would need the browser in front: they go into a file
  input as if chosen there, or are dropped on a drop zone. Agents confirm with you first.
- `shot` takes a screenshot.
- `close` closes one of the agent's tabs, or all of them. They also close when the chat ends.
- Changing one of your tabs needs `allow_user_tab`, and the tab you are viewing also needs `allow_current_tab`. Agents are
  told to use those only if you asked.

**In Safari the agent's tabs are in your own window**, at its end and behind the tab you are on. Nothing marks them:
they look like any tab. Safari has no hidden window of an agent's to stumble over: its Dock icon and the links you click
in other apps do what they always do, and to see what the agent is doing, or to sign in for it, you click its tab.
`show` brings that tab to the front when you ask. If you have no Safari window, the agent's first page opens one, behind
what you are using.

Safari has no ids for tabs, and you open, close and move tabs around the agent's. So each of its tabs carries a mark in
its page's storage, which you don't see, and UCU finds the tab by it before every step. A page that goes to another
site loses the mark, since Safari keeps such storage per site. UCU then takes the tab in the same place only if every
other tab of the window is as it was and the page came there from the agent's page; without that proof the step fails,
and the agent has to say which tab is its own, or open the page again. A step never runs in a tab that may be yours.

A screenshot needs a tab that its window shows. While the agent's tab is behind yours, `shot` loads the same address
in a window on the private desktop, takes the picture and closes that window again, so the picture is of a fresh copy:
what the agent typed or opened in the page isn't in it. Safari's new window shows for an instant where yours are when
it is made.

Safari gives a page that isn't in sight, in a tab behind another or a window behind others, no animation frames and one
timer tick a second, so an app that draws in them, such as Google's admin console, stands still. Some pages also act
only on input the browser vouches for, which a click made by script isn't. For those the agent takes its tab `away`:
the page loads in a window on the private desktop, where it is in sight and runs at full speed, and where `click` with
`real` presses an element as you would: UCU finds where it is on that screen and clicks there. When a step waits in
vain on a page that is paused, UCU tells the agent so, since from the page it only looks slow. When the turn ends the
page is a tab in your window again. While it
is away Safari has a window you don't see, so a link you click in another app can open there: UCU moves such a tab to
your window at the agent's next step.

**In Chrome each chat works in a window of its own**, on the private desktop whenever the agent works in it, where pages
behave as on a screen and `look` and `act` reach it by its title, which is how an agent handles Chrome's own controls.
It is hidden when the turn ends, stays for the next page when its tabs close, and closes when the chat ends.

- `show` brings that window to your screen, in front, when you ask to see it or have to do something in it, such as
  sign in. It is a normal window that you use, and the agent keeps working in the same one, so there is one page and no
  copy. `hide` takes the window back out of sight; until then it stays with you, also after the chat ends.
- While you have that window, you can open tabs in it. The agent finds its own tab again before each step, is told
  which tabs are there and which one you are on, closes only its own tab there, and takes no screenshot that would
  switch the tab you are on.

Chrome comes forward for an instant when it makes the agent's window, once a chat, and UCU puts your app back at once.
Tabs open blank and go to their page through the page itself, which keeps Chrome behind, when Chrome allows JavaScript
from Apple Events. A page that runs none, such as one of Chrome's own, brings Chrome forward for an instant as well. An
extension's popup closes once Chrome loses focus, so agents open its page in their tab instead, at
`chrome-extension://<id>/<page>`.

With UCU's own extension, Chrome doesn't come forward for either. AppleScript, which UCU drives Chrome with, can't make
a window or set a tab's address without that, and an extension can: it makes the agent's window unfocused, already on
the private desktop, in your own Chrome and profile, so the agent has your logins as before. Set it up once:

1. Run `./ucu install`, which lets Chrome start the extension's host, `scripts/ucu-chrome-host.py`.
2. In Chrome, open `chrome://extensions`, turn on **Developer mode**, click **Load unpacked** and choose this folder's
   `chrome-extension`.

The extension asks only for native messaging: it can't read your pages or history. It takes two requests from UCU, to
make a window and to load an address in a tab; reading, clicking, typing and screenshots stay as they are. It connects
when Chrome starts, or when you load it, so load it after `./ucu install`, or press its **Reload** afterwards. Whenever
it doesn't answer, UCU does those two steps through AppleScript as before, with nothing to configure. To be rid of
it, remove it at `chrome://extensions`.

Safari needs **Safari > Settings > Advanced > Show features for web developers**, then **Develop > Allow JavaScript from
Apple Events**. Chrome needs **View > Developer > Allow JavaScript from Apple Events** for everything that runs in a page.
Both need permission for the app running Claude Code to control the browser, which macOS asks for the first time, and
`shot` needs Screen Recording for that app. Clicks and typing are synthetic, so some logins ignore them.

A native Open dialog, such as Chrome's Load unpacked, opens in the background and its sidebar works, but choosing a file
in it needs the keyboard, so agents ask you to pick it. An unpacked extension loaded once can be reloaded in the background
from the Reload button on `chrome://extensions`.

### Several agents

Each chat has its own engine, so chats on different apps work at the same time. Each also keeps a small file in
`~/Library/Application Support/ucu/sessions/`, and when an agent gets an app another agent used in the last 3 minutes, it
gets a note saying who. Two agents on the same window still undo each other's work, so the note asks it to wait or ask you.
Each chat's browser window is its own, on its own desktop, and a chat that ends leaves the others' windows alone.

### Cursors

Each chat has a cursor with a soft shadow, in a color no other chat is using. A chat in the same folder gets the same
color when it is free. The cursor takes a curved path to each action, leans into the move, stays just above the window it
is working on, and fades out when the turn ends. It takes no clicks and never moves your pointer. An agent working on a
hidden app or on the private desktop shows no cursor, because nobody could see it. In Safari and Chrome a click or
typing in a page shows the cursor where it lands while that page is in sight, such as the agent's tab when you are
looking at it. In a tab behind another there is nothing to point at.

## Other MCP clients

Any client that speaks MCP over stdio can run the server directly, once `./ucu install` has built the engine:

```json
{
  "command": "python3",
  "args": ["-I", "/path/to/universal-computer-use/ucu/scripts/ucu-proxy.py"]
}
```

Without the `Stop` hook, a turn ends after 2 minutes without a call.

## Update

UCU keeps itself up to date. As a chat starts, its server looks for new commits on the branch this clone follows, at most
every 10 minutes and in the background. It fast-forwards the clone and rebuilds the engine or `ucu-window` when their
code changed, and the next chat runs the new version. It leaves a clone with local changes or commits of its own alone,
and undoes an update whose engine doesn't build. What it did is in `~/Library/Logs/ucu/update.log`.

To update now, run `./ucu update`. To stop updating by itself:

```bash
touch ~/Library/Application\ Support/ucu/no-auto-update
```

## Uninstall

```bash
./ucu uninstall
```

This removes the server, hook, engine, `ucu-window` and the Chrome extension's host. Your policy, logs and backups
stay in `~/Library/Application Support/ucu/` and `~/Library/Logs/ucu/`.

## How it works

| Path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `ucu` | The `install`, `uninstall`, `update`, `doctor`, `deny`, `allow` and `denied` commands. |
| `scripts/ucu-proxy.py` | The MCP server. It runs the engine, keeps the deny list, renders windows as short text and adds notes. |
| `native/ucu-window.swift` | `ucu-window list/focus` and `ucu-window watch`, which opens apps hidden, reports new windows, holds the private desktop and draws each chat's cursor. |
| `native/browser.js` | The browser side of the `safari` and `chrome` tools, run with `osascript`. |
| `chrome-extension/` | UCU's Chrome extension, which makes the agent's window and loads addresses with Chrome staying behind. |
| `scripts/ucu-chrome-host.py` | The extension's native messaging host. It relays between the extension and each chat's server over `~/Library/Application Support/ucu/chrome.sock`. |
| `..` | agent-desktop, the engine. See `../FORK.md`. |

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

These run the real server and installer against a fake engine in a temporary `HOME`, with fake `claude`, `swiftc` and
`cargo`.
