"""Stdio MCP proxy that Claude Code launches for the `ucu` server.

    ucu-proxy.py [--turn-idle S] [--stop-grace S] [--stop-idle S] [-- <cua-repl command...>]

Without a command it runs cua_repl as the newest usable Codex computer-use plugin
defines it (~/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-bundled/unified-computer-use/<version>/.mcp.json),
read again at every start, so a Codex update reaches open chats the next time
cua_repl starts.

Each chat's Claude Code process starts its own copy, so everything below is per
chat. It passes every message through unchanged, except that it

* adds the Codex turn metadata (`_meta["x-codex-turn-metadata"]` = session_id,
  turn_id) that cua_repl expects on each `tools/call`. Without it the browser
  surface fails with "Missing required Codex turn metadata", and Sky cannot tie
  actions to a turn;
* ends the turn when Claude's turn ends. The Stop hook that `ucu install` adds to
  ~/.claude/settings.json sends SIGINFO to the proxy of the chat whose turn ended
  (`pkill -INFO -P $PPID -f ucu-proxy.py`). Without a hook (an interrupted turn) the turn ends
  after --turn-idle seconds without a call (default 120). Ending a turn runs
  `SkyComputerUseClient turn-ended` (what Codex itself runs after every turn, via
  `notify` in ~/.codex/config.toml) so Sky can drop its per-turn state, and, when
  the turn used the browser surface, calls cua_repl's `turn_ended` tool so
  that surface detaches from its tabs;
* stops cua_repl, with its JavaScript kernel and sandbox processes, once the chat
  has not used it for --stop-grace seconds after a turn ended (default 120), or
  for --stop-idle seconds in any case (default 900). Between uses the chat then
  holds only this proxy (about 24 MB) instead of several hundred MB;
* starts cua_repl again on the chat's next request (~0.3 s), replaying Claude's
  `initialize` handshake. Earlier JavaScript variables such as `app` are gone
  after a restart and must be fetched again;
* shortens what the agent has to read. The first-use documentation (~22k characters,
  ~5.5k tokens) comes without its browser part until a call uses a browser, and with a
  summary of its confirmations policy when that policy is the version the summary was
  written from. A restarted cua_repl sends the documentation again with its first `js`
  result: when this chat already has that copy, it is left out and a one-line note says
  so. Calling `js_reset` brings it back on the next `js` call, for when the earlier copy
  is gone from Claude's context (compaction, /clear). The tool list loses the browser
  examples in `js` and the two tools agents have no use for, and the sentences the
  engine repeats on every state it returns get shorter;
* answers cua_repl's per-app approval prompt (`Allow Computer Use to use "<app>"?`)
  itself from ~/Library/Application Support/ucu/policy.json: apps in `deny` are
  declined and every other app is accepted. The file is read at every prompt, and
  every decision is logged to ~/Library/Logs/ucu/approve.log with the client and
  folder that caused it. If the file cannot be read the prompt goes to the client,
  so a denied app cannot slip through;
* adds two tools of its own next to cua_repl's: `list_windows` and `focus_window`
  pick which window of an app `cua.getApp` acts on (always the app's main window)
  by running ~/.local/bin/ucu-window, which `ucu install` builds from
  native/ucu-window.swift. They answer without starting cua_repl;
* keeps apps out of the user's way. `cua.getApp` opens a closed app on screen, behind
  the user's windows, and fails on an app that opens no window in the background. So
  before a `js` call that gets a closed app, `ucu-window watch` opens it hidden, unless
  it is denied. The engine reads, screenshots and clicks elements of a hidden app as
  usual, without showing it. Clicks by coordinates need a window on screen, so before a
  call that uses them the app moves to the agent's desktop, a virtual display nobody
  sees, or is shown behind the user's windows if there can't be one. If an app an
  agent's action opened or drives comes to the front by itself while the user isn't
  typing or clicking, the user's app is put back;
* gives each chat a Safari window of its own through the `safari` tool (native/safari.js).
  The engine can only act on an app's main window, which in Safari is the one the user
  works in. This window stays hidden, and `list` shows what the user has open without
  touching it;
* takes a `window` argument on `js`, so that an agent can work on several windows of an
  app in one turn: the window becomes the app's main window, and calls with a window run
  one at a time. Code inside `js` can't do this itself, because the engine's sandbox
  keeps it from seeing other apps;
* tells an agent when another chat is using the app it is getting, through one small
  file per chat in ~/Library/Application Support/ucu/sessions;
* explains engine errors where they happen, so that the next try is the right one;
* tells the agent about windows it wouldn't see: new windows and sheets of the apps it
  drives, and system dialogs such as password prompts, with their text and buttons, in
  a note on a `js` result. Like alert sounds, nothing waits for them;
* tells the agent when an app it drives plays the macOS alert sound. Humans hear
  that an input was rejected, but the engine still reports success, so the proxy
  watches the system sound server's log while cua_repl runs and adds a note to a
  `js` result. Nothing waits for a sound: it reaches the log 2-13 ms after the call
  that caused it returns, so it comes with that result if a read followed the
  action in the same call, and with the next result if not. It needs no permission
  and hears no audio;
* adds ucu's usage rules to the `instructions` in cua_repl's `initialize` reply,
  so they reach every client and not only those with the rules in their own config;
* answers a request left unanswered by a cua_repl that exited on its own with an
  error, instead of leaving Claude waiting for the 5-minute tool timeout. The error
  warns that the action may already have happened, so it is not blindly repeated;
* answers Claude Code's pre-`initialize` `server/discover` probe itself with
  "method not found". cua_repl (rmcp) closes the connection on that probe,
  which makes Claude Code kill and respawn the server (~2 s per session start).

The proxy itself runs for as long as the chat, so Claude never sees ucu
disconnect; only cua_repl stops and starts behind it. (Claude Code 2.1.299 does
reconnect a server that exited, but only on the next call, after its discovery
probe and a full handshake.) SIGINFO is used because its default action is to be
ignored, so a proxy started from an older version of this file, which has no
handler for it, is left alone.

`ucu install` registers this file as the `ucu` server. Its tests are in
tests/test_proxy.py, tests/test_plugin.py, tests/test_policy.py, tests/test_alerts.py and
tests/test_windows.py.

- Open apps with `cua.getApp`, never `open`: ucu opens them hidden, so the user isn't disturbed.
- For Safari, use the `safari` tool, not `cua.getApp`: it works in your own hidden window while the user is in theirs.
- One `js` call can drive several apps. To work on several windows of one app in a turn, send one `js` call for each \
with `window: {{app, title}}`: ucu runs them in turn.
- If clicks or keys have no visible effect, stop and tell the user: remote-desktop and canvas apps can ignore \
background input.
- Don't sleep for a slow app. In the same `js` call, run `const {{ waitForChange }} = await import("{WAIT_HELPER}")`, \
then `await waitForChange(app, () => app.click(8), {{ timeoutMs: 20000 }})`.
- Pass `timeout_ms` to `js` for slow apps; the default is 30 seconds.
- `app` can disappear between turns: get it again. Don't call `js_reset` when you finish.
- Don't let two agents drive the same app at the same time."""

- Always confirm right before acting: deleting data; changing permissions; the last step of creating an account; API \

subscribing or unsubscribing; payments; VPN, security or password settings; medical actions.
- Confirm unless the first prompt allowed it: logins (going to a site implies logging in to that site), browser \
permission prompts, age checks, third-party "are you sure?" warnings, uploads, moving or renaming files, and sending \
sensitive data, which includes typing it into a form or a URL. That approval must name the data and the destination.
- No need to confirm: cookie banners, terms during sign-up, downloads, and anything else.
